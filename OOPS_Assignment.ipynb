        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?<br>\n",
        "Ans. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of methods (functions). It promotes modularity, code reuse, and abstraction.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of the class will have.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with the attributes and behaviors defined by its class.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?<br>\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "*  Encapsulation: Binds data and methods together and restricts access to some components using access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Dunder (double underscore) methods, like __init__, __str__, and __add__, provide special functionality and allow operators and built-in functions to interact with objects.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Inheritance allows a class (child) to derive properties and behaviors from another class (parent). It promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows the same method or operation to behave differently in different contexts, like method overriding or operator overloading.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Encapsulation is achieved by defining attributes as private (using a single or double underscore, e.g., _attribute or __attribute) and providing public methods for access (getters and setters).\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. A constructor is a special method (__init__) that is automatically invoked when an object is created. It initializes object attributes.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Class methods: Declared with @classmethod, they take the class itself as the first argument (cls).\n",
        "*  Static methods: Declared with @staticmethod, they do not require a class or instance reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Python does not support true method overloading. Instead, we can achieve it by default arguments or by checking argument types in the method.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class, overriding occurs.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The @property decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, enabling controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. It enables flexibility and code reuse by allowing the same interface or operation to work with different types or classes.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and serves as a template for other classes. It is created using the ABC module and typically contains abstract methods.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans.\n",

        "*  Code reuse through inheritance\n",
        "*  Modularity and organization\n",

        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Class variable: Shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "*  Instance variable: Specific to each object and defined within the __init__ method.\n",

        "<hr>\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and  `__repr__` methods in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   __str__: Provides a user-friendly string representation.\n",
        "*   __repr__: Provides an official string representation, primarily for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The super() function allows a child class to call methods from its parent class, often used in inheritance.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The __del__ method is a destructor method called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   @staticmethod: Does not access the class or instance; used for utility functions.\n",
        "*   @classmethod: Accesses the class object as its first argument.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism allows methods in derived classes to override methods in base classes while maintaining a consistent interface.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?<br>\n",
        "Ans. Method chaining involves returning the object itself (self) from a method, allowing multiple methods to be called sequentially on the same object.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function, enabling callable objects.\n",
